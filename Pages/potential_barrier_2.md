Your rook still moved but was blocked and fell just short of black's position.

Two other cases need to be looked at. 

- When both pieces are trying to move past each other.
- When one piece blocks another from moving at all. 

When the first happens, the piece that moves first takes priority and lands at their destination. The other piece is then blocked by the first. 

The second case occurs when one piece moves right up to the other moving piece.

The black rook on a8 hasn't yet moved to a5. Try moving your a1 rook to a7.

As you will see black will be blocked and will not move at all. If black's rook moved first then it would land at a5 and white's rook would be blocked and be placed at a4.
