# Annihilation

When opposing pieces both move to the same destination square they capture each other in what is called an **annihilation**. 

For a pawn this is an alternate way of capturing a piece that isn't on a diagonal.

Try to move the e2 pawn to e4. The e5 pawn will move forward and annihilate with the white pawn.
