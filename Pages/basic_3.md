# Pieces

There are 6 unique pieces. Each piece, other than the King, has a capture value representing it's strength and the advantage given to the opponent once captured.

- **Pawns** start by filling the second and seventh ranks with a value of 1.
- **Rooks** start on the corners of the board with a value of 5.
- **Knights** start next to rooks with a value of 3.
- **Bishops** start next to knights with a value of 3.
- **Queens** start on the d file and are next to the bishops of the c file. They have a value of 9.
- **Kings** are next to their queens and bishops on the e file. 

Kings have no inherent value as the goal of the game is to force the king into a checkmate and it is illegal to capture them. They are the most important piece.

Checkmate is explained under the King's move lesson.

As the game progresses, the net piece capture value is displayed for the winning side to show a total advantage score. This is only displayed in live games, not in lessons and is displayed with the pieces summing to the score.
