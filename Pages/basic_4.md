## Superposition

In certain situations, your pieces may be able to move to squares occupied by pieces of the same color, but this is only allowed if the opponent also targets the same piece. 

In such cases, the opponent captures your original piece but your active moving piece immediately counters with a recapture, takes the opponents piece, and lands on the destination square. This is called a <strong>super-position</strong>.

If your opponent selects a different active move instead, the recapture is illegal, the move is undone, an error sound is played, and you then must play a legal move.

In this position black will attempt to capture the pawn on d4 with their pawn on e5. Execute a recapture with the queen by moving it from d1 to d4.

> Note well that recaptures are not counted as possible moves for a stalemate condition. A position with only recaptures possible would be considered a stalemate.
> Stalemate is explained under the King's moves lesson.
