# Collapse

If both pieces land at the other piece's initial position, they capture each other due to *double entanglement*, this is called a **collapse**.

A common opening play may be to play e4 and d5. Both pawns can use this opportunity to then capture the other one as the opponent will likely do so since there's no immediate counter.

Try this out.
