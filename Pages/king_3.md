# Castling

The king has a special move called **castling**.

This consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it.

Castling is only allowed when the all of the following is met:

- The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;
- There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
- The king may not currently be under attack, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece  (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);
- The castling must be kingside or queenside.

An unmoved king and an unmoved rook of the same color on the same rank are said to have *castling rights*.

In this setup castling rights are given to the white king and h1 rook and the black king and the a1 rook only. Play a kingside castle by moving the white king to g1. Notice that black performs a queenside castle.
