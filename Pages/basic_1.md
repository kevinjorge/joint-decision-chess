# Introduction

Chess has players playing as either White or Black pieces on one side of the chess board.

Regular Chess has players taking turns moving pieces of their own color, but in ***Decision Chess***, both players move simultaneously. After selecting their moves, both pieces-in-play are played at the same time, they are called <strong>active pieces</strong> before being played.

The game starts symmetrically. That is, the side you start as doesn't matter, what matters is how both players play together.

Pieces can only be captured by those of the opposite color. 

Left-clicking a piece shows its available moves (solid circles) and captures (outlined circles). Pieces can be selected, then moved, by clicking the destination or dragged to them.

Right-clicking a square highlights it. When you right click, then hold and drag to another square, releasing it creates arrows. They are usually used for planning moves. There is also the option to share arrows with your opponent to communicate with them. Arrows can be removed by left-clicking or redrawing them.

Once a move is chosen it is active. A transparent version of the piece is displayed at its destination until the opponent plays a move.
