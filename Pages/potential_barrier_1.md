# Potential Barriers

Pieces cannot simply jump through each other if both are active pieces, unless they are knights.

If one piece tries to move to a destination but the opponent moves inside that piece's path (but does not land at the destination) then the piece lands just short of the opponent's destination. This is called a **potential barrier**.

In this example, black's bishop on f8 will move to h6. Try to capture the h7 pawn with your rook.
