During games you have the option to execute some actions that affect the board or game. The command center holds these buttons and the running list of moves of the game.

##### Undo Move

In a live game, the player may be able to undo the last set of played moves. If the game is multiplayer, clicking the Undo Move button sends an undo offer to the opponent. If they accept, then the last move of both sides are undone. For AI or solo games, it automatically reverts the moves.

##### Resign

The resign option is available to forfeit a game as soon as the first set of moves have been played at any time.

In multiplayer games, a player has the option to offer a draw. The opponent will receive a draw request and if it is accepted, the game ends in a draw.

##### Cycle Themes

By clicking the cycle themes button the board will cycle between predefined color themes. This can also be performed by clicking the board and pressing "t". The default theme or set of cycled themes can be set in a logged in user's settings.

##### Flip

##### Move list

A list of moves is displayed and updated as the game is played. The first column is always white's move, the second is black's move, the row number is the turn the moves were played. 

Moves can be revisited to review them by clicking the step buttons or clicking the row in the list. To resume playing you must step back to the latest move.
