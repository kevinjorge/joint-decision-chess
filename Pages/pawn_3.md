# En passant

Pawns have a special move called ***en passant***.

When a pawn advances two squares on its initial move and ends the turn adjacent to an enemy pawn on the same rank, it may be captured en passant by the enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square.

This is only possible on the move immediately following the pawn's advance.

Black has just moved their b7 pawn to b5. You may now play en passant with the c5 pawn to b6 to capture it.

Notice that the f5 pawn cannot do the same and capture the g5 pawn as the opportunity is lost.
