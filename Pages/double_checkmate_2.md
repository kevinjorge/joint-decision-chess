You may consider that both positions are in a sort of coupled pseudo anti-Zugzwang, where they are both incentivized to make the best possible move. 

Where **Zugzwang** is a German word used to describe a situation wherein one player is put at a disadvantage because of their "*compulsion to move*".

For this position let's call it Dual "**Zugpflicht**", the latter is German for "*obligation to move*".

Zugpflicht indicates the moral obligation to move with freedom to do otherwise. The obligation here is to themselves and secondly the collective win-win outcome.

As a fun exercise consider what the fastest way to execute a double checkmate is if both sides try to coordinate this. If both players try to perform the standard 4-move scholar's mate simultaneously it won't work and there will be issues to circumvent.
