# King

The **King** is the center piece of the game. It cannot be captured.

It moves one square in any direction.

A king is ***in check*** when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. 

It is illegal to make a move that places one's king into check. Once under check a move must be made to remove the check. The possible ways to get out of check are:

- *Move* the king to a square where it is not in check.
- *Capture* the checking piece (possibly with the king).
- *Block* the path of the check with another piece.

A piece may be unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king).

Notice that the black king is free to move to any adjacent square by selecting it.

The white king is under check and has adjacent squares that it cannot move to as they are under attack by the rook. Select it to view the available moves. Note that the available moves for other pieces is also restricted to those that remove the check such as the only valid queen move.
