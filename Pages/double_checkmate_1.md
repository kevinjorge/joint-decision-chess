# Double Checkmate

Decision Chess may open up a rare and unique game over opportunity.

Given both players may attack while ignoring their own king at the same time, this allows for a <strong>double checkmate</strong> to occur.

This example shows that protecting the king is futile for either side. Both rooks are one move away from checkmating the opponent's king while also being blocked from protecting their own. 

If the pawns blocking the rooks weren't there, they could rush to defend their own king.

Play the winning move and discover the double checkmate.
