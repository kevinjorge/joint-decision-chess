Pieces cannot move through each other's initial positions, or end positions (unless they use the same path and have priority) but they can move past each other's paths if the direction is not shared. 

If one rook was moving horizontally and another vertically they there is no interaction. Move the g4 rook to b4 and see that the e6 rook is uninterrupted.
