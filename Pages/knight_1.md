# Knight

**Knight**s move in an L shape.

They move two squares in either the vertical or horizontal direction then move 1 square by making a left or right turn. This allows up to 8 possible positions to land on.

They are the only piece that can jump over other pieces.

See how the white knight can jump over it's allied pieces and how the black knight has many squares it can move to.
