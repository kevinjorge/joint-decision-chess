# Coordinates

The board has dimensions of 8 by 8 squares, each labelled with a unique coordinate.

The columns are called **files** and are labelled left to right from "a" to "h", the rows are called **ranks** and are labelled bottom to top from "1" to "8". These labels start from white's orientation. 

Squares are then labelled with coordinates starting with the file then the rank. For example, the white king starts on e1.

Try moving the pawn on d2 to d4.

Notice that the current and previous positions are highlighted on a move and are colored differently for both sides.
