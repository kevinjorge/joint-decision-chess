                <p>
                    Decision Chess is a variant of chess that will require the move of each player to be locked in before playing them, 
                    additionally there are no turns during "active" play. That is, both players can move their pieces on the same turn and both 
                    moves will be played at the same time once they both agree to proceed. 
                    <br>
                    The full official name of the variant is thus called <strong><em>Joint</em>-Decision Chess</strong>, but that's less catchy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, this site only offers the classical standard version of chess while basic functionality is developed and enabled.
                    It will allow for classical games and decision chess games in the future. The following is a list of some major upcoming features and pages. <br>
                    Stay tuned...
